                    Season
                    one showrunner Steven DeKnight explained that Murdock is "not super strong. He's not invulnerable...
                    he
                    just
                    has senses that are better than a normal human's." On the character's "grey" morals, he noted, "He's
                    a
                    lawyer by day, and he's taken this oath. But every night he breaks that oath, and goes out and does
                    very
                    violent things." The character's Catholicism plays a large role in the series, with DeKnight calling
                    him
                    "one of the most, if not the most, religious characters in the Marvel Universe". Cox worked with
                    blind
                    consultant Joe Strechay, and was conscious of what his eyes were doing at all times, to ensure they
                    would
                    not look at or react to something unlike a blind person. Skylar Gaertner plays a young Matt Murdock.

                    to
                    "steer differently than that" with Page. Woll noted that Page's backstory would be different from

                    one
                    from the comics, saying, "In the comic books, in the beginning Karen is very innocent, and then

                    the
                    end she's really swung a full 180, she's in a lot of trouble, so I wanted to find a way to make her

                    of
                    those things at the same time. Can she be a really wonderful, kind person who is a little bit

                    to
                    danger? She's not just always getting into trouble because 'Oh, silly woman!' Karen is actually

                    those things. He does have comic relief, but it was exciting to know that these other characters

                    his
                    portrayal of Fisk was a new way to look at the character, and that it would be the definitive
                    portrayal
                    of Fisk. DeKnight detailed that "Fisk has very many different aspects so it's not all, "I want to
                    conquer the city and make a lot of money". In our story, we tell the story of how he met his wife
                    Vanessa and how they fell in love". He also said that "if you're looking for a juicy, multi-faceted
                    crime drama, Wilson Fisk was the obvious choice to play the antagonist ... [he] really felt like the
                    right yin to the yang for Matt, and for what we wanted to do this season." Cole Jensen plays a young
                    Wilson Fisk.

                    Daredevil's origin is revealed in the comic's first issue. Bookish Matt Murdock pushes a man clear of an oncoming truck but is blinded when he lands in an unknown radioactive substance. Matt is the son of boxer “Battling” Jack Murdock, who is attempting to rebuild his career with the help of a crooked promoter known as the Fixer. While attending law school, Matt engages in an intense physical training regimen, aided by heightened senses that were triggered by the accident that took his sight. When his father is killed after refusing to throw a fight, Matt dons a costume and becomes Daredevil, vowing to bring his father's killers to justice. Upon being confronted by Daredevil, the Fixer promptly dies of a heart attack, so establishing the terrifying effect the hero has on criminals.

In addition to his elevated senses and martial prowess, Daredevil's crime-fighting arsenal includes a cane that contains a grappling hook and cable for scaling walls.

                    Daredevil no. 1 also established the strip's supporting cast: Murdock's partner in his law firm, Franklin (“Foggy”) Nelson, and their secretary Karen Page. Over the following decade, Lee and other writers built up a formidable and bizarre rogues' gallery for Daredevil, including the Owl, Mr. Fear, and Stiltman. Much like Spider-Man and his alter ego Peter Parker, Daredevil is a fast-talking joker while Murdock is tortured and morose.
